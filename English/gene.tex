\maketitle
\par There are some changes that the moulds poured by an aqueous suspension of the genetic codes of life rather than metal liquid.Similar biofoundries are being set up around the world,from the Broad Institution in Cambridge to the National University of Singapore.On the example of London,the foundry¡¯s customers can order parts from the library or provide their own proprietary snippets.Then all the required parts will transfer to the bar-coded wells to get mixture.The next is to react with PCR.Then the plasmids are introduced into living cells and are incubated.Finally,the result is test to see which ,if any,of the circuits performs as expected.
\par At the moment,every foundry is going its own way,as the industry finds its feet.The test¡¯s particular specialities is preclinical drug screening,which makes them cheaper to carry out test in house.The biofoundries will play part in the next phase of the Industrial Revolution.
